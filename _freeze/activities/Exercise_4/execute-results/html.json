If the answers aren't at the top of your mind, don't fret! We've barely started speaking this new language, and learned a ton of vocab last week, so you naturally won't remember it all.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Import data\nsurvey <- read.csv(\"https://ajohns24.github.io/data/112/about_us_2024.csv\")\n\n# How many students have now filled out the survey?\n\nnrow(survey)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 28\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# What type of variables do we have?\n```\n:::\n\n\n### EXAMPLE 1: Hangout Preferences {.unnumbered}\n\nStudents were asked, in that moment, where they'd most like to spend time outside. How did they answer? Was there a lot of agreement or a lot of variability in answers? Build and interpret a plot that helps address these questions while reviewing:\n\n-   \"code as communication\"\n-   connecting with the components of a plot:\n    -   set up a **frame**\n    -   add a **layer** / geometric element\n    -   change the **theme**, e.g. axis labels, color, fill\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Attach a package needed to use the ggplot function\n\n\n# Make a ggplot\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n### EXAMPLE 2: Temperature Preferences {.unnumbered}\n\nStudents were asked about their ideal outdoor temperature, in degrees Celsius. How did they answer? What was the typical response? What was the range in responses? Were there any outliers? Build and interpret 2 plots that help address these questions.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n::: {.callout-note title=\"Bar Charts vs. Histograms\"}\nBar charts & histograms can appear pretty similar, but they do different things.\n\n-   **Bar charts** count up the number of observations of each outcome of a variable. They're good for *categorical* variables, or *quantitative* variables with only a handful of possible outcomes.\n-   **Histograms** count up the number of observations that fall into different numerical *ranges* of variable. They're good for *quantitative* variables, especially those with many different observed outcomes.\n:::\n\n## New stuff\n\nThus far, we've been studying one variable at a time, using *univariate* plots. But once we get a sense of how individual variables behave on their own, our questions often turn to *relationships* among variables. For example, in our `hikes` data:\n\n-   How much `time` does it take to complete a hike? ------\\> How is `time` related to a hike's `elevation`? What about its `length`?\n-   How does difficult `rating` vary from hike to hike? -------\\> How is difficulty `rating` related to a hike's `ascent`?\n\n### Exploring relationships\n\nExploring univariate patterns often sparks follow-up questions about **relationships** between 2+ variables. Often, but not always, variables take on specific roles:\n\n-   **response variable**: the variable whose variability we would like to explain (`time` to complete a hike)\n-   **predictors**: variables that might explain some of the variability in the response (a hike's `elevation` or `length`)\n\nVisualizations can help explore:\n\n-   relationship *trends* (direction and form)\n-   relationship *strength* (degree of variability from the trend)\n-   *outliers* in the relationship\n\n#### EXAMPLE 3 {.unnumbered}\n\nFor each pair of variables below, sketch on paper a visualization of their relationship.

In general:\n\n-   Each **quantitative variable** requires a new *axis* (or a quantitative *scale* if we run out of axes).\n-   Each **categorical variable** requires a new way to \"group\" the graphic (eg: using colors, shapes, separate facets, etc)\n-   For visualizations in which **overlap** in glyphs or plots obscures the patterns, try faceting or transparency.\n\n## Exercises (required)\n\n[Github user Tony McGovern](https://github.com/tonmcg/US_County_Level_Election_Results_08-20) has compiled and made available 2020/2016/2012 presidential election results for most of 3000+ U.S. counties, except Alaska.

Any ideas why this might be the case?)\n\n### Exercise 4: Visualizing trend {.unnumbered}\n\nThe trend of the relationship between `repub_pct_20` and `repub_pct_16` is clearly positive and (mostly) linear. We can highlight this trend by adding a model \"smooth\" to the plot:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = repub_pct_16)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth()\n```\n:::\n\n\n#### Part a {.unnumbered}\n\nConstruct a new plot that contains the model smooth but does *not* include the individual point glyphs.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n#### Part b {.unnumbered}\n\nBy default, `geom_smooth()` adds a smooth, localized model line.

Summarize the relationship between these two variables and comment on which is the better predictor of `repub_pct_20`, `median_rent` or `median_age`.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Scatterplot of repub_pct_20 vs median_rent\n\n\n\n# Scatterplot of repub_pct_20 vs median_age\n```\n:::\n\n\n### Exercise 6: A Sad Scatterplot {.unnumbered}\n\nNext, let's explore the relationship between a county's 2020 Republican support `repub_pct_20` and the `historical` political trends in its state. In this case `repub_pct_20` is **quantitative**, but `historical` is **categorical**. Explain why a scatterplot might *not* be an effective visualization for exploring this relationship.

In the plot below, notice that we simply created a separate density plot for each `historical` category. (The plot itself is \"bad\" but we'll fix it below.) Try to adjust the code chunk below, which starts with a density plot of `repub_pct_20` alone, to re-create this image.\n\n![](https://mac-stat.github.io/images/112/density_demo.png){width=\"50%\"}\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(elections, aes(x = repub_pct_20)) +\n  geom_density()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Exercise_4_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-27-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Exercise 9: Quantitative vs Categorical -- Density Plots {.unnumbered}\n\nWork through the chunks below and address the comments therein.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Name two \"bad\" things about this plot\nggplot(elections, aes(x = repub_pct_20, fill = historical)) +\n  geom_density()\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# What does scale_fill_manual do?\nggplot(elections, aes(x = repub_pct_20, fill = historical)) +\n  geom_density() +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"blue\", \"purple\", \"red\"))\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# What does alpha = 0.5 do?\n# Play around with different values of alpha, between 0 and 1\nggplot(elections, aes(x = repub_pct_20, fill = historical)) +\n  geom_density(alpha = 0.5) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"blue\", \"purple\", \"red\"))\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# What does facet_wrap do?!\nggplot(elections, aes(x = repub_pct_20, fill = historical)) +\n  geom_density() +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"blue\", \"purple\", \"red\")) +\n  facet_wrap(~ historical)\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Let's try a similar grouping strategy with a histogram instead of density plot.\n# Why is this terrible?\nggplot(elections, aes(x = repub_pct_20, fill = historical)) +\n  geom_histogram(color = \"white\") +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"blue\", \"purple\", \"red\"))\n```\n:::\n\n\n### Exercise 10 {.unnumbered}\n\nWe've now learned 3 (of many) ways to visualize the relationship between a quantitative and categorical variable: side-by-side violins, boxplots, and density plots.\n\n-   Which do you like best?\n-   What is one pro of density plots relative to boxplots?\n-   What is one con of density plots relative to boxplots?\n\n### Exercise 11: Categorical vs Categorical -- Intuition Check {.unnumbered}\n\nFinally, let's simply explore who *won* each county in 2020 (`winner_20`) and how this breaks down by `historical` voting trends in the state. That is, let's explore the relationship between 2 categorical variables! Following the same themes as above, we can utilize grouping features such as fill/color or facets to distinguish between different categories of `winner_20` and `historical`.\n\n::: {.callout-important title=\"Be Quick\"}\nSpend at most 5 minutes on the following intuition check.
