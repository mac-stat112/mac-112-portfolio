For example, in the NYT example above, the research team mapped data like the following (but with many more rows!) to the plot:\n\n\n\nobservation\ndecade\nyear\ndate\nrelative temp\n\n\n\n\n1\n2020-30\n2023\n1/23\n1.2\n\n\n2\n1940-60\n1945\n3/45\n-0.05\n\n\n\nWrite down step-by-step directions to use a data table like this one to create the temperature visualization. A computer is your audience. Thus be as precise as possible, but trust that the computer can find the exact numbers if you tell it where.\n\n\n\n\n\nCOMPONENTS OF GRAPHICS\nIn data viz, we essentially start with a blank canvas and then map data onto it. There are multiple possible mapping components. Some basics from Wickham (which goes into more depth):\n\na frame, or coordinate system\nThe variables or features that define the axes and gridlines of the canvas.\na layer\nThe geometric elements (e.g. lines, points) we add to the canvas to represent either the data points themselves or patterns among the data points. Each type of geometric element is a separate layer. These geometric elements are sometimes called “geoms” or “glyphs” (like heiroglyph!)\nscales\nThe aesthetics we might add to geometric elements (e.g. color, size, shape) to incorporate additional information about data scales or groups.\nfaceting\nThe splitting up of the data into multiple subplots, or facets, to examine different groups within the data.\na theme\nAdditional controls on the “finer points” of the plot aesthetics, (e.g. font type, background, color scheme).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEXAMPLE\nIn the NYT graphic, the data was mapped to the plot as follows:\n\nframe: x-axis = date, y-axis = temp\nlayers: add one line per year, add dots for each month in 2023\nscales: color each line by decade\nfaceting: none\na theme: NYT style",

Especially when there are many possible outcomes of the quantitative variable, it’s typically insufficient to simply count up the number of times we’ve observed a particular outcome (as the bar graph did above). It gives us a sense of ranges and typical outcomes, but not a good sense of how the observations are distributed across this range. We’ll explore two methods for graphing quantitative variables: histograms and density plots.\nHistograms are constructed by (1) dividing up the observed range of the variable into ‘bins’ of equal width; and (2) counting up the number of cases that fall into each bin. Check out the example below:\n\n\nPart a\nLet’s dig into some details.\n\nHow many hikes have an elevation between 4500 and 4700 feet?\nHow many total hikes have an elevation of at least 5100 feet?\n\n\n\nPart b\nNow the bigger picture.
