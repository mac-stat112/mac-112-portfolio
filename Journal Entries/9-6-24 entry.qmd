Cmd+shift+I is a shortcut for new R code in qmd
Unclear what “![](url)” does in qmd…
“!” takes it from url–>image
“[]” becomes the caption for the image
Make sure to leave spaces between code (e.g. "x = 100" as opposed to "x=100")
“jo_scare”= “snake case” 

Why “qmd”?
markdown(formats, but doesn’t run code)–>Rmarkdown(runs R code)–>Quarto Markdown (works with multiple coding languages–Python, Java, and Julia)
